# CineQuest Web Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the Film Discovery web application CineQuest!
This web application uses API data from the TMDB API to provide the user with the most popular films of the moment, the ability to search films they know and to see detailed information about these films. Each film's detail page includes a Discover section, showcasing personalized recommendations to help users find new and interesting movies to watch. Additionally, users can create an account, and once logged in, they can build a watchlist of films they plan to watch or compile a list of their favorite movies. 

The application starts on the homepage where the user can search for a film in the search bar or go to another page, using the navigation bar. Scrolling down on the homepage there is a short overview of some of the most popular films at the moment. The library page also shows the most popular films but more of them. Then there is the possibility to see a film's detailed information by clicking on a film's movie poster. The detail page of a film also shows Discover mode where an overview of the best similar films is shown to the user, creating the possibility of discovering new and interesting films to watch. A user can create an account by signing up and then logging in to be able to see their profile page and to be able to add films to their watchlist or favorites list by clicking on the icons on the film's movieposter icons.
